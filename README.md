### Construction 🛠️
In this subject we work with language C# and a videogame's engine [Unity](https://www.unity.com/).

This time I work under a Micro$oft environment with a IDE, Visual Studio Community and Unity Editor to create 2D games (this is required by this subject 👨‍💻). The videogame's industry use it and it has a great tools.

But in general I prefer and recommend to use a programming environment with GNU/Linux because this OS is prepared for that:

* [GNU/Linux OS](https://www.linuxmint.com) - LinuxMint
_This is enought to develop in C++ (Sorry, C# is bit hard level) and other programming languages but if you want use any IDE or complex text processor... use it! 🙌_

## Execute 🚀
If you want execute any exercise, first must compile it. You can use VS Solution (recommend now) or IDE compatible with .NET-C# source code. Maybe that's be a nightmare from console.

I recommend to compile source code with Visual Studio Community or Visual Studio Code with C# Dev-kit and Unity plugins, the officials extensions from Micro$oft.👉👈🙄🧁

🌂Disclaimer: Majority configuration of Visual Studio is a hard task because this is no flexible in some aspects and sometimes require low-level knowing about this IDE. Be careful with that too!

 ## Personal Notice ⚠️
This source codes are solutions for programming subject's exercices, be careful if you copy&paste. Maybe the code works but It isn't the best or It has a lot personal annotation.

Exits a lot of ways resolve a same problem and programming guides. I don't care if you've can resolve with a better way (good for you!) or you don't like the code or I'm wrong with my coding way because I'm always learning in my career and life. I will better in next commit!

Please, don't be lazy hater! 🙏 Sometimes we comments that make be feel bad to the people.
